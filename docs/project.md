<summary><b>Milestone 0: Group Contract</b></summary>

## Milestone 0: Group Contract

**Objective:** Establish group expectations, assign roles, and set up collaboration tools.  

As part of this milestone, you will meet with your group to establish a **Group Contract**. This contract will outline your team’s expectations, roles, and responsibilities to ensure smooth collaboration throughout the project. 

Download group contract templates from D2L Brightspace assignment page.

**Possible roles you can assign:**  
- Project Manager (coordinates deadlines, oversees progress)  
- Lead Writer (adapts the case, designs the storyline)  
- Game Designer (structures the Twine game, manages branching logic)  
- Documentation Lead (takes notes, keeps reports consistent)  
- Quality Assurance (tests the game, organizes peer reviews, integrates feedback)  
- Graphics/Media Specialist (creates or sources images, designs visual elements)

During this process, your group project manager will also create a **private** GitHub repository for your project. This repository will be the central hub for all your project files, including your Twine game, reports, and any other relevant documents. The project manager will invite all group members AND the course instructor ([@parsa-rajabi](https://github.com/parsa-rajabi)) as collaborators to the repository.


**Deliverables:**  
- Submit your signed **Group Contract** as a PDF to D2L Brightspace
- Submit the link to your **Private** Project GitHub Repository (with all members and instructor added as collaborators) to D2L Brightspace

<summary><b>Milestone 1: Gamified Ethical Case Study Prototype + Brief Report</b></summary>

## Milestone 1: Gamified Ethical Case Study Prototype + Brief Report

**Objective:** Create a first playable prototype of your ethical game.  

Use **Twine** to build your team's **first playable prototype** of an ACM-inspired ethical case study. Your classmates will peer-review this version, so make it accessible (deployed to a website) and engaging.

It is recommended to first draft your game structure and storyline using pen/paper and/or a flowchart or diagramming tool (e.g., [Miro](https://miro.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/), etc.) before building it in Twine. 

Remember, this is a prototype, so focus on creating a basic but functional version of your game that meets the core requirements. You can refine and expand it in Milestone 2.

**Steps:**  
1. Choose an [ACM case study](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies) and adapt it into an interactive storyline.  
   1. You can NOT choose the Malware case study (Case 1) as it is already adapted in Twine.
2. Draft a flowchart of branching choices (recommended tools: Miro, Figma, Whimsical).  
3. Build a playable **Twine prototype** with (minimum requirements):  
   - Info Page (case study title + ACM link, group names + roles, clear instructions for players).  
   - At least **3 distinct endings** (outcomes) based on player choices.
   - **Realistic, scenario-appropriate choices** that lead to different paths.
   - **Two or more perspectives/stakeholders**. 
   - **Creative adaptation** (not copy/paste) of the original case study.   
   - At least **one media element** (image, sound, or video, etc.).  
4. Deploy the game online using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), or similar.  
5. Document your process in a short report.

### Game Deployment (Live Version)
Your game must be **hosted online** using a **free** static web hosting service like [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), or another equivalent. The goal is to make your game immediately playable online without needing downloads.  

Feel free to choose whichever platform works best for your group—just make sure it’s accessible in a browser and the URL is stable.

### Report Requirements
Write a brief (3 page max) document including:
- **Cover Page**: group info (names, roles, student IDs) and link to your deployed game - *this page does not count towards the page limit*
- **Case Study Chosen** and why you selected it
- **Prototype Workflow**: overview of paths and player choices; include 1–2 screenshots
- **Draft List of Ethical Dilemmas** your players will face
- Any **external references** in IEEE citation format (if applicable)

### Submission Instructions (one submission per group)
- Export your Twine game as HTML and submit with the filename `A2_G#_GameName.html` 
- The **PDF documentation**, named: `Project_G#_M1.pdf` (must include your public game URL on the cover page)

<summary><b>Milestone 1.5: Retrospective Meeting</b></summary>

## Milestone 1.5: Retrospective Meeting

**Objective:** Reflect on feedback and team progress.  

As part of the course Learning Logs, other students in the class will be providing **peer reviews** of your Milestone 1 prototype. This includes feedback on gameplay, ethical dilemmas, and overall engagement. 

During this phase, your group will review the feedback received and hold a **retrospective meeting** to reflect on your teamwork and project progress. This is an opportunity to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to apply these lessons moving forward. Document the key takeaways and action items from this meeting.

**During this meeting:**  
- Reflect on how each member performed in their assigned role.  
- Decide if any roles should change for Milestone 2 (recommended to rotate roles so everyone gets experience in different areas).
- Document key lessons learned and action items (such as what to keep and what to improve).  
- Plan how to incorporate peer feedback into your next milestone.
- Prepare a brief summary of your discussion.
- Sign (electronically is OK) and date the summary to confirm all members participated.
   - This can be signed digitally OR handwritten and scanned.

You may choose to use online templates or tools to facilitate your retrospective meeting, such as [Miro](https://miro.com/templates/retrospective/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/team-meetings/retrospective?editor_type=figjam).

**Deliverables:**  
- Submit a 1-page (with signatures) summary of your retrospective discussion as a PDF named `Project_G#_M1.5.pdf`.
