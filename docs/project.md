## Structure

## Project Details

- This project is a collaborative, group-based assignment where you will develop an interactive ethical case study using [Twine](https://twinery.org/).
- You should make steady progress throughout the term and keep developing your project across all milestones.
- All group members must actively use GitHub for version control, submission, and collaboration.
  - Your progress will be tracked through your commits, so make sure to document and push your work to GitHub regularly.

This project is broken down into multiple milestones:

- Milestone 0: Group Contract  
- Milestone 1: Gamified Ethical Case Study Prototype + Report  
- Milestone 1.5: Retrospective Meeting  
- Milestone 2: Refined Ethical Game + Report

<summary><b>Milestone 0: Group Contract</b></summary>

## Milestone 0: Group Contract

Meet with your group of 5 and draft a **Group Contract** that all members sign. This contract will set your group’s expectations and roles.

**Possible roles you can assign:**  
- Project Manager (coordinates deadlines, oversees progress)  
- Lead Writer (adapts the case, designs the storyline)  
- Game Designer (structures the Twine game, manages branching logic)  
- Documentation Lead (takes notes, ensures AI disclosure, keeps reports consistent)  
- Quality Assurance (tests the game, organizes peer reviews, integrates feedback)  

**Deliverables:**  
- Submit your signed **Group Contract** as a PDF to D2L Brightspace
- Submit the link to your **Project GitHub Repository**

<summary><b>Milestone 1: Gamified Ethical Case Study Prototype + Report</b></summary>

## Milestone 1: Gamified Ethical Case Study Prototype + Report

Use **Twine** to build your team's **first playable prototype** of an ACM-inspired ethical case study. Your classmates will peer-review this version, so make it accessible and engaging.

### What your Twine prototype must include
- **Info Page** containing:
  - The case study title (with ACM link)
  - Group members’ names and roles
  - Clear instructions for players  
- At least **three distinct endings**
- Realistic, scenario-appropriate choices
- **Multiple perspectives** (e.g. different stakeholder roles or ethical viewpoints)
- Creative extension or adaptation of the original case—don’t just copy/paste

### Game Deployment (Live Version)
Your game must be **hosted online** using a **free** static web hosting service like [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), or another equivalent. The goal is to make your game immediately playable online without needing downloads.  

Feel free to choose whichever platform works best for your group—just make sure it’s accessible in a browser and the URL is stable.

### Light Documentation (PDF)
Write a brief (3 page max) document including:
- **Cover Page**: group info (names, roles, student IDs) and link to your deployed game - *this page does not count towards the page limit*
- **Case Study Chosen** and why you selected it
- **Prototype Workflow**: overview of paths and player choices; include 1–2 screenshots
- **Draft List of Ethical Dilemmas** your players will face
- Any **external references** in IEEE citation format (if applicable)

### Submission Instructions
- Export your Twine game as `A2_G#_GameName.html` 
- Host it online with a free static hosting service, and include the **public link** in your PDF
- Submit:
  - The **HTML game file**
  - The **PDF documentation**, named: `Project_G#_M1.pdf`

**Tip**: Deploy your game early so peers can play your version right away—it makes peer review much smoother!

<summary><b>Group Project Expectations & Policy</b></summary>

## Group Project Expectations

This project is designed for teamwork. Each member should:

- **Communicate Regularly**: Stay in contact with your group members.  
- **Attend Meetings**: Be present and engaged at all group meetings.  
- **Maintain Professionalism**: Treat everyone with respect and courtesy.  
- **Deliver Quality Work**: Complete your tasks on time and do your best.  
- **Seek and Offer Help**: Support your teammates and ask for help when needed.  
- **Foster Inclusivity**: Encourage everyone to share their opinions.  
- **Be Receptive**: Accept feedback and be willing to adapt.  
- **Promote Equal Contribution**: Make sure all members participate equally.  
- **Stay Accountable**: Take responsibility for your actions and tasks.  
- **Engage Actively**: Participate fully in discussions and activities.  
- **Update Regularly**: Keep your team informed about your progress and challenges.  
- **Decide Collectively**: Make team decisions together, not individually.  
- **Be Transparent**: Be honest and clear about all project matters.  

### Group Project Participation Policy

**Goal**: To ensure everyone contributes fairly and to handle any non-participation issues properly.

#### Step 0: Peer Resolution

- Before any official action, try to resolve any non-participation concerns within your group.  
- If you need to escalate, be prepared to provide written evidence of your attempts to resolve the issue (e.g., meeting notes, emails).  

#### Strike 1: Initial Consultation for Non-participation

- If concerns remain after peer resolution, and a majority of your group plus your TA agree, you may be identified for non-participation.  
- You will be asked to meet with your TA and the instructor.  

**During this meeting:**  
1. Review concerns and evidence.  
2. Hear your perspective.  
3. Develop an action plan.  
4. Emphasize the importance of teamwork.  

- The TA will document the meeting.  

#### Strike 2: Transition to Individual Project

- If non-participation continues after the first consultation, and a majority of your group and TA observe inadequate contribution again, you will be notified.  

**What happens next:**  
1. You will switch to an **independent project** of similar scope and complexity.  
2. You must complete the project within the same timeframe as your group.  
3. The instructor will provide formal expectations.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Open communication can help prevent issues.  
- The instructor will consider extenuating circumstances.  
- Collaboration guidelines will be provided at the start of the project.
