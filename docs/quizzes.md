## Before the quiz:
- Update your computer so it doesn't start updating in the middle of your quiz.
- Try out your internet before and a few hours before the quiz. If you're using Wi-Fi, think about plugging into the internet with a cable.
- Make sure other devices aren't using up all the internet while you're on the quiz.
- It's a good idea to have a backup plan, like another computer or different internet, just in case. You may also be able to use the computers located on campus.

<!-- ## Quiz Rules
- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etcâ€¦)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-IDE (e.g. VSCode) EXCEPT websites and plugins that help you cheat such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload 
- Copying the question text and googling **IS CHEATING**
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you **IS CHEATING**
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating (however using any AI-based search engine i.e. BingAI **IS CHEATING**).
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do NOT share quiz questions with anyone: that **IS CHEATING**
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine. -->
