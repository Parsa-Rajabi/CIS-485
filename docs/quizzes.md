- Try out your internet before and a few hours before the quiz. If you're using Wi-Fi, think about plugging into the internet with a cable.
- Make sure other devices aren't using up all the internet while you're on the quiz.
- It's a good idea to have a backup plan, like another computer or different internet, just in case. You may also be able to use the computers located on campus.

## Quiz AI policy
Given the nature of an online course, it is not practical to fully monitor or restrict the use of AI tools during exams and quizzes. While monitoring software exists, I have chosen not to use it, as strict enforcement would conflict with creating a welcoming and inclusive learning environment that I strive to foster.  

Instead, the exams and quizzes in this course are intentionally designed so that success depends on your **active participation** in all course components, including both live and asynchronous activities. The questions are structured to reward genuine engagement and understanding. In other words, relying on AI tools during an exam or quiz will not help you arrive at the correct answers and may even lead you astray.  


## Quiz Rules
- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans - cats and dogs in the room are fine).
- Any form of communication with other humans, terrestrial or extraterrestrial is not allowed (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Terminal, Signal, iMessage, SMS, MMS, etcâ€¦)
- The test is open-book, open-notes, open-IDE (e.g. VSCode) EXCEPT websites and plugins that help you cheat such as Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions you upload 
- Copying the question text and googling **IS CHEATING**
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you **IS CHEATING**
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating (however using any AI-based search engine i.e. BingAI **IS CHEATING**).
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab.
- Do NOT share quiz questions with anyone: that **IS CHEATING**
- Overall, do not stress! You will be fine.
