## Course Instructor

**Name:** Parsa Rajabi

**Email:** parsa.rajabi [at] ufv [dot] ca

**Office Hours:** By appointment

<!-- Zoom appointments can be made by email request (a minimum of 24 hours in advance). Request for appointments with less than 24 hours notice may not be accommodated. -->

**All inquiries should be sent to the instructor via email. D2L Brightspace Messages are NOT monitored/answered**

Note: When emailing, please include the following in your email:

- Subject: `[CIS 485 ON1] - Your Subject`
- In the body, include your full name, student ID, and your inquiry.

This course requires significant commitment for both the instructor and the students. The course is designed to be interactive, with a focus on hands-on learning and practical applications of ethics and social responsibility. Students are expected to actively engage in group work outside of class time and to collaborate with their peers on semester-long project. **A lighter course load is strongly recommended to ensure active participation, high-quality work, and the potential to earn a top grade.**

### Professionalism 

Students are expected to maintain a high level of professionalism in all course activities, communication with the instructor and peers, as well as timely responses to instructor emails (e.g. within 2 business days). This includes proper email etiquette, respectful communication in class, and adherence to deadlines. Before sending an email, please ensure that you have included a subject line, a greeting, a clear message, **your full name/student ID#** and a closing. Using AI/ChatGPT to generate emails is **not recommended** and **such emails will be returned for revision**.

> [!WARNING]
> Before sending an email, make sure to review this article on [email etiquette](email-etiquette.md) and/or [How To Email Your Professor](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~ilaba/teaching/email.html) for tips on how to effectively communicate with your instructor. **Emails that do not follow these guidelines will be returned to the sender for revision.**

Repeated unprofessional behavior will result in grade deduction from your final grade, with each violation resulting in a 1% deduction. Students will be notified of possible deductions after the first warning.

## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. This grade is calculated based on peer evaluations received from your team members, as well as the quality of your contributions to the project. Completing detailed and thoughtful peer evaluations also contributes to your grade.

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:

1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally based on the group's agreed-upon terms in the group contract. This includes documenting these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with the instructor. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the instructor will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the instructor.
3.	**Instructor Intervention**: Following the consultation, the instructor may involve other group members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all individuals. If additional actions are needed, the instructor will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.** 

### Weekly Modules (Flipped Classroom) 

This course will be taught using a pedagogical technique known as the [Flipped/Hybrid classroom](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/flipped-classrooms).  This approach makes the most of our precious class time by eliminating the standard lecturing model, where course material is introduced to the students during class, usually via a lengthy PowerPoint presentation.  In our Flipped/Hybrid classroom, you will come to class having already completed several pre-assigned material (and videos) where you will be introduced to the course material.  During class, you will apply your understanding of these core concepts through carefully-chosen problems and activities, which will enable you to solidify your knowledge.  

Flipped/Hybrid classrooms require much more focus and preparation time, for both the instructor and the students.  After all, it is much easier for the instructor to read a set of pre-prepared slides and for the students to passively observe and listen.  But in our class, we will devote our class time to the computational thinking process: resolving obstacles, developing conceptual understanding and communicating solutions supported by evidence. Through this process, you will better develop your confidence, creativity, and critical-thinking skills (i.e. Computational Thinking), preparing you to become a successful problem-solver in the real world.

In order for this course to be a meaningful learning experience, you will need to come to each class well-prepared, with all assigned modules and videos complete. This emphasis on assigned learning logs/assignments is the reason why the course is structured as it is. If you do not complete the modules, you will have a hard time following the in-class activities, which will make it that much harder for you to successfully complete the course deliverables.

I have designed this course so that you will be spending approximately 9 to 12 hours per week on all activities relating to this course (i.e., learning logs, assignments, attending class, all assessments).

## Classroom Etiquette

The classroom principles that we will follow in the classroom are transparency, equity and inclusion, participation, active dialog, and constructive critique. Students are expected to support each other, learn from each other, and help each other grow. Students have the responsibility to conduct themselves in ways that will help them learn, yet that will not disrupt other students’ learning. While each student may be working closely with their team members, you are also expected to engage with your classmates in a respectful, kind, and helpful manner.

In the class, we encourage asking questions, sharing ideas, and engaging in discussions related to the class topics. Sometimes discussions may steer away from the course content, and the course instructor will reserve the right to re-direct it back on track.

Giving and receiving feedback is one of the core activities in this class. When giving and receiving feedback, it is important to keep in mind that we give feedback because we want all students to succeed. Our feedback will highlight parts that work well but also point out aspects that can be improved. The feedback should not be taken personally or seen as an attack on students' knowledge or capabilities. Thus, we will learn a craft of constructive feedback and practice it in the class regularly.

The maximum score for each course component is 100%. The final grade will be calculated based on the weighted average of the components.

## Assignment
The course includes one individual assignment, which involves completing the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS 2: CORE-2022) course. This assignment is designed to provide foundational knowledge on ethical principles and guidelines for conducting research responsibly. Refer to the [As#signment page](assignment.md) for detailed instructions and submission guidelines.

### Learning Logs 
Learning logs are short, reflective exercises designed to help you engage with the course material and apply it to real-world scenarios. They will be assigned periodically throughout the course and are intended to encourage critical thinking and personal reflection on the topics covered.

All learning logs must be completed through D2L Brightspace's discussion board and completed individually.

### Quizzes 
There will be two quizzes (+ syllabus quiz) during the semester, designed to assess your understanding of the course material. Quizzes will be conducted online through D2L Brightspace and will cover topics discussed in class and assigned readings. For more details, please refer to the [Quiz page](quizzes.md).

### Project
The course project is a significant component of this course, designed to provide hands-on experience in applying ethical principles to real-world scenarios. You will work in groups to create an interactive Twine game based on a selected case study, allowing you to explore and present ethical dilemmas in an engaging format. For more details, please refer to the [Project page](project.md).


### Letter Grade Conversion
![](images/grade_letters.png)

### Grade Solicitation Policy

Requests for grade adjustments (especially final course grade) based on non-academic reasons are not appropriate and are considered unprofessional. Examples include, but are not limited to, statements such as "I need this grade," "I deserve a higher grade" or any similar personal circumstances.

Students are expected to meet the academic requirements of the course as outlined in this syllabus. Soliciting grade changes undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and may result in a negative impact on your final grade.

If you have concerns about your performance, you are encouraged to seek feedback early and make use of available resources, such as office hours and course support services, to address any challenges proactively.

## Passing Criteria

- Students must attain the following in order to obtain a clear pass (C- or better) in the course:
  - A passing grade (>50%) on the weight average of quizzes
  - A passing grade (>50%) on the final project (including project presentation)

## Course and Policies

### Late Policy and Missed Items

Course elements such as assignments and learning logs can be submitted up to 24 hours after the due date with a 25% penalty. After 24 hours, the submission will not be accepted and a score of zero will be assigned.

Make-up assessments (including assignment, quiz or project) will not be given. Sometimes life gets in the way of schedules. Sickness or other unplanned or extraordinary events happen and will be dealt with individually. It is your responsibility to ensure your situation is known to the instructor as soon as reasonably possible. You are accountable for being heard, which means you need to ensure that the instructor heard you.
 
While "life happens," poor planning by you does not count. And definitely do not wait to discuss gray areas. For example, an interview opportunity arises (good!): you should not wait until the day before the assignment is due to let your instructor know that you could not complete the assignment because you had to prepare for the interview. That would be considered poor planning. Good planning would be to alert the instructor that you got the interview and, while you hope to finish the assignment, there is a concern. Then when you don’t finish on time, it’s clear that you planned your time and that will be taken into consideration. These "good planning" situations will be considered individually as per the instructor's discretion.

In all cases, exceptional situations are considered on an individual basis, subject to the approval of the instructor and supported by legitimate and verified documentation. 

### Remarking Policy

As an instructor, I strive to provide fair and accurate assessments of your work while also providing as much feedback. I encourage you to review the feedback and spend your time/energy where it serves you the most which will be learning from past mistakes and self-improvement. While you reserve your right to ask for a re-grade, I find debating grades an incredible drain of time and energy and prevents me from serving students well and focusing on most important aspects of the course. 

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and feedback/comments (if applicable).
2. Schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss the feedback and marking.
3. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written letter for the re-marking and be submitted to the course instructor within 5 business days from receiving the mark or a deadline specified by the instructor, whichever comes first. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

> [!WARNING]
> Course grades are considered final on a rolling basis (e.g. as we progress through the semester). After the regrading request deadline (e.g., 5 business days or deadline set by instructor), grades will be considered final and no further requests will be accepted. Students are encouraged to review their grades and ask questions within the specified time frame. Inquiries after the deadline will not be considered.

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the instructor and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final. 

### AI Policy

Please refer to the [AI Policy page](ai-policy.md) for detailed information on the use of AI tools in this course.

### Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is important to me and I know it is to most students. Cheating is never worth the risk to your personal and professional reputation. I expect students to be truthful and honest in their work. This means that any work you submit for individual evaluation should be yours alone and that you recognize the work of others if you use their ideas, thoughts or material. The assignments have been designed to ensure that you learn the material. I ensure that all students are graded fairly and will take action against students who violate the [academic dishonesty policy 70](https://www.ufv.ca/media/assets/secretariat/policies/Student-Academic-Misconduct-(70)-Procedures.pdf). Students who engage in any acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception will face penalties for violating UFV policy, which can include failure in the assignment and/or a FD-Failed for Discipline grade on your transcript. Listed below are some examples of academic dishonest behavior that will result in a grade penalty:

#### Plagiarism

This refers to passing off the work of another as your own. Make sure to cite all your sources if you incorporate the words or ideas of another person. This includes sources from books, journals, the internet, emails, live presentations (e.g. speeches) and even relevant conversations with other people. You can avoid plagiarism by appropriate citation and referencing in your papers, projects and presentations.

#### Unauthorized Sharing of Computers 

Students are also prohibited from sharing computers or using another student’s computer to complete any course material (e.g., assignments, module tests or quizzes). This includes sharing code, files, or any other content that is to be submitted for grading. Students who have difficulty with their computer (e.g. hardware or software failure) should contact the instructor immediately for assistance. 

#### Inappropriate use of technology in coursework

The use of technology to produce content for your assignments that is not specifically listed in the syllabus as permissible is strictly prohibited. **All submissions for grading must be your own work.**

#### Collusion / Unauthorized Collaboration

You are expected to complete all assignments for this course on your own. When assigned individual work, it is unfair to collaborate and gain an unfair advantage over your classmates who complete their work on their own. Collusion includes sharing homework, quiz or test questions and answers with other students. Examples of collusion:

- Working on answers with a friend for a homework assignment or during an open book exam
- Using “tutoring websites” (e.g. Chegg, CourseHero) to find answers to assignment/ exam questions
- Assisting others to cheat by answering questions that are posted to a FB/ WhatsApp group
- Falsifying/ fabricating information

**Do not misrepresent yourself or your work.** The following are examples of prohibited behavior:

- Making up sources or facts
- Misrepresenting your identity by asking someone else to complete any portion of a course (i.e. make comment on a discussion board, quiz, exam)
- Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University, including (but not limited to) doctors note’s in order to gain an academic advantage

#### Unauthorized use of note-sharing websites

You may come across websites that claim to help students by providing answers to test questions and encourage students to upload your instructor’s copyrighted material (e.g. lecture slides, exam questions, etc.) Sharing exam/assignment questions is strictly prohibited as this material is the intellectual property of the instructor and should not be shared in any format. Furthermore, beware of uploading your own completed assignments as you could be assisting other students to cheat using your material. Assisting others to cheat is strictly prohibited in the UFV student academic integrity policy.

Note sharing sites expect their users to comply with the Honour Code of their organization. Their own policy mandates that they cooperate with an investigation of academic dishonesty. The UFV Academic Integrity Office routinely monitors these sites for evidence of cheating and will initiate discipline proceedings against students who violate the UFV Student Academic Integrity policy.

#### Unauthorized use of tutors / editors

If you plan to use a tutor/editor, be aware that any work that you submit must always be your own. An ethical tutor will always focus on explaining concepts so that you can become an independent learner. You are violating the student academic integrity policy if:

- A private tutoring company coaches you on how to complete an assignment
- You buy / sell / swap assignment questions and answers on social media platforms like WeChat, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc.
- Your use an editor (paid or unpaid) without permission of the instructor to revise, correct or alter your work

## First Class Attendance

As per [UFV Policy 62](https://www.ufv.ca/media/assets/secretariat/policies/Attendance-(62).pdf): Students must attend the first day of class and complete the activity as assigned by the instructor in order to keep their seat in the course.  Failure to do this may result in an automatic withdrawal and students on the registered class waitlist who are in attendance will be given your spot. If you are unable to attend the first day of class, please contact the instructor in advance (at least 24 hours before class).
